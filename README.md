# Urban Service Requests Analysis for Rutgers – New Brunswick

This project leverages data science, machine learning, and time-series forecasting to analyze urban service requests in New Brunswick—home to Rutgers University. By examining open datasets related to waste management, infrastructure, property maintenance, and public safety, we provide actionable insights that help optimize city operations, enhance public safety, and support data-driven urban planning.

## Project Overview
This repository contains code, notebooks, and documentation for a comprehensive analysis of urban service requests in New Brunswick. Our goal is to leverage open data and advanced machine learning techniques—such as Facebook Prophet, ARIMA, XGBoost, and deep learning—to forecast trends, identify anomalies, and derive actionable insights in areas like waste management, infrastructure, property maintenance, and public safety.

## Key Features
- **Data-Driven Urban Analysis:** Integrates open datasets to understand service request trends and seasonal patterns in New Brunswick.
- **Advanced Forecasting:** Utilizes Facebook Prophet and ARIMA for time-series forecasting of service request volumes.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Employs XGBoost and deep learning models for classification and anomaly detection.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Generates dashboards and static reports that illustrate spatial and temporal trends, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.
- **Agile Project Structure:** Fully documented and organized to facilitate collaboration and reproducibility.

## Methodology

### Data Collection & Processing
- **Open Data Sources:** We source urban service requests data from local government and state open data portals. If a dedicated Rutgers – New Brunswick portal isn’t available, alternative city 311 datasets are used as examples.
- **Data Cleaning:** Raw data is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, standardize categories, and convert dates into usable formats.
- **Data Integration:** Additional datasets (e.g., weather or demographic data) are merged to enhance our analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Trend Analysis:** Identify overall volume, seasonal patterns, and anomalies in service requests over time.
- **Category Breakdown:** Visualize data by service category (e.g., waste management, property maintenance) to pinpoint which issues are most prevalent.
- **Geospatial Insights:** Map the data to uncover geographic clusters and hotspots of service requests.

### Machine Learning Models
- **Time-Series Forecasting:**  
  - **Facebook Prophet:** Captures complex seasonality and holiday effects to forecast future service request volumes.  
  - **ARIMA:** Provides a classical approach to model and predict trends.
- **Predictive Classification:**  
  - **XGBoost:** Classifies request types and detects anomalies using structured features.
  - **Deep Learning Models:** Utilizes RNNs/LSTMs and text classification networks to capture nonlinear trends and subtle textual cues.
- **Model Evaluation:** Models are compared using error metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) and classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall).

## Urban Impact Analysis

### Waste Management
- **Key Insights:** Analysis of bulk pickups and illegal setouts reveals seasonal spikes (e.g., May surges linked to student move-outs).
- **Impact:** Forecasts suggest optimized scheduling could reduce costs by 15–20%.

### Property Maintenance
- **Key Insights:** Seasonal spikes in property maintenance requests (e.g., overgrown grass in spring/summer) are identified.
- **Impact:** Enables businesses to adjust staffing and marketing strategies accordingly.

### Infrastructure & Transportation
- **Key Insights:** Pothole reports and parking violations increase in colder months due to freeze-thaw cycles.
- **Impact:** Forecasts aid in proactive resource allocation and maintenance scheduling.

### Public Safety
- **Key Insights:** Patterns in emergency and social service requests help predict community needs.
- **Impact:** Forecasting supports faster, more efficient resource allocation for public safety.

## Visualization & Reporting
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Explore data through dynamic maps and time-series visualizations.
- **Static Reports:** Detailed notebooks and exported PDFs summarize findings, trends, and model performance.
- **Geographical Mapping:** Visualize hotspots and distribution of service requests across New Brunswick.
